## 🔧 Known Issues

### Installation Requirements

Due to peer dependency conflicts between Capacitor packages, Cypress requires special installation:

```bash
# Step 1: Install base dependencies
npm install --legacy-peer-deps

# Step 2: Force install Cypress
npm install cypress@13.17.0 --save-dev --force

# Step 3: Verify
npx cypress --version
```

See `CYPRESS_INSTALLATION.md` for detailed guide.

## 🚀 Running Tests

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure dependencies are installed correctly (see above)
2. Start the development server: `npm run serve`
3. Server must be running on `http://localhost:8080`

### Commands

```bash
# Run all E2E tests (headless)
npm run test:e2e

# Open Cypress Test Runner (interactive)
npm run test:e2e:open

# Run tests in specific browser
npm run test:e2e:chrome
npm run test:e2e:firefox
```

## 📊 Test Results from GitHub Actions

When pushed to GitHub, the CI/CD workflows will automatically:
1. Install dependencies with `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
2. Install Cypress with `npm install cypress --save-dev --force`
3. Build the application
4. Run all Cypress tests
5. Upload screenshots on failures
6. Block deployment if tests fail

## ✅ Workflow Status

All three GitHub Actions workflows have been updated and are ready:

- ✅ `e2e-tests.yml` - Standalone E2E testing
- ✅ `deploy.yml` - Production deployment with E2E tests
- ✅ `deploy-dev.yml` - Development deployment with E2E tests

## 📝 Test Quality

### Code Quality
- ✅ All tests are language-agnostic (work with any i18n locale)
- ✅ Tests use data-attributes and href selectors (reliable)
- ✅ Custom commands for reusable test logic
- ✅ Proper test isolation (beforeEach clears state)
- ✅ No hard-coded waits (uses Cypress retry-ability)

### Coverage Areas
- ✅ Authentication flows (login, register, recovery)
- ✅ Form validation
- ✅ Navigation and routing
- ✅ PWA features (manifest, service worker, offline)
- ✅ UI components and interactions
- ✅ Accessibility (a11y) standards
- ✅ Security (XSS, auth, input validation)

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate
1. ✅ All core files committed and pushed
2. ⏳ Create Pull Request for `feature/cypress-e2e-tests`
3. ⏳ Review and merge to develop
4. ⏳ Monitor first GitHub Actions run

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Run remaining test files (navigation, pwa-features, etc.)
- [ ] Add visual regression testing
- [ ] Implement API contract testing
- [ ] Add performance testing with Lighthouse
- [ ] Cross-browser testing on Edge/Safari
- [ ] Mobile device testing on real devices
- [ ] Increase test coverage to 95%+
- [ ] Add code coverage reporting

## 🔒 Quality Assurance

### Test Reliability
- Tests are isolated and independent
- No test depends on another test's state
- Proper cleanup in beforeEach hooks
- Language-agnostic selectors

### CI/CD Integration
- Tests run automatically on push to master/develop
- Tests run on all pull requests
- Deployment blocked if tests fail
- Artifacts saved for debugging

### Maintenance
- Tests use semantic selectors (will survive refactoring)
- Custom commands reduce code duplication
- Documentation keeps tests maintainable
- GitHub Actions ensure tests stay current
